**Accuracy Review**

Your answer is **accurate and concise**. It provides a clear and accurate definition of Python decorators, emphasizing their purpose in modifying the behavior of functions or classes.

**Senior Python Developer Interview Assessment**

**Strengths:**

* Clearly defines what decorators are.
* Highlights the ability to enhance function or class behavior without permanent modification.

**Potential Improvements:**

* Could provide a simple code example to illustrate how decorators are used.
* Could mention additional benefits of using decorators, such as code reusability and extensibility.

**Overall Evaluation:**

Your answer demonstrates a solid understanding of Python decorators. While it provides a precise definition, a brief code snippet would further enhance its clarity for senior-level interviewers.

**Code Example Suggestion:**

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before", func.__name__)
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After", func.__name__)
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    print("Inside my_function")

my_function()
```

This example shows how the `my_decorator` modifies the behavior of `my_function` by printing "Before" and "After" messages around the original function call.
